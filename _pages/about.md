Welcome to **ENGL 3844 &ndash; Writing &amp; Digital Media**! In this course, I introduce fundamental practices and emerging theories of writing <i>with and for</i> digital media. We will learn basic authoring in web-development syntaxes, critical interpretation of online sources, social media management, and topics of computational abstraction for writers.

**This course is production-heavy**, and it demands that you read the required texts and practice the assigned skills. Some weeks may prove lighter, while others more intensive. In particular, we will learn how to create a responsive, single-page website near the end of the semester. I note this at the start of the semester to help you make time to complete this course successfully.

By the end of this course, you will have completed the following objectives:
