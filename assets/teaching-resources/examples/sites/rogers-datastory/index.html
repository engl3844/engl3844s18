			<div class="intro-explanation">  <p> Music streaming services enable people to listen millions of track without having to download individual files, and on multiple devices. The ease of access, low cost, personalization, and convenience have made today’s streaming services most consumers’ first choice listening method.  According to <i>Forbes</i> over 100 million people pay for music streaming, roughly 1/3 of which subscribe to Apple Music. </p>  </div>

			<p> As an Apple Music subscriber, I enjoy the control and freedom that Apple Music gives me over what I listen to – but I also became curious about how the music streaming service controls me, and how it shapes my listening habits.   For one whole week, I collected data about what I listened to and how I found it on the Apple Music app.  <em>Click on the graph to see how the app shaped what I listened to for the week.</em> </p> </div>

			<div class="apple-music-app"> <img src="assets/img/apple-music-for-you.PNG" alt="Apple Music For You" width="100%"/> <p class="paragraph-border"> The “For You” section on the app includes albums, songs, and daily custom-curated playlists picked out for you, as well as a weekly algorithmic “New Music” mix, all of this based on the music you listen to, what music you tell the app you “love” or “dislike”, and the genres and artist choices you made when first joining Apple Music. </p> </div>
			<div class="apple-music-app"> <img src="assets/img/apple-music-browse.PNG" alt= "Apple Music Browse" width="100%" /> <p class="paragraph-border"> The Radio section allows you to listen to stations of your favorite genres, or create their own custom station.  Custom stations can be fine-tuned by tapping the star and tapping “play more like this” or “play less like this”. </p> </div>
			<div class="apple-music-app"> <img src="assets/img/apple-music-radio.PNG" alt="Apple Music Radio" width="100%" /> <p class="paragraph-border"> The Browse section of the app is dedicated to finding the best new music specifically for you – highlighting new songs, albums, and artists Apple Music thinks you’ll like. </p>  </div>

			<div class="video-explanation"> <p> Much of the success of Apple Music can be credited to how the app tailors the experience to each user’s musical taste.  They do this by collecting hundreds of data about the music each person plays, loves, adds, etc., using this data to create algorithms that construct each consumer’s listening experience.  Though these algorithms help listeners to find more music within their preferences, it’s also inevitable that they are also constantly shaping users’ listening habits.  In this way, they also limit exposure to music that is outside of the user’s main interests. Music streaming services have revolutionized the amount of freedom we have when it comes to listening, but the algorithms many of these services use are also indirectly narrowing the scope of the different types of music we’re exposed to.  Once broad and shallow, exposure to music is becoming increasingly narrow and deep.  This is neither good nor bad, but it is definitely a major change.
