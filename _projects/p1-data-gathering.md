## Description

[Datafication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datafication) represents the recent trend for an increased use of digital technology and media to collect, organize, and analyze data about ourselves. Most of these insights, however, are not shared with us as users and are commodified in unregulated ways, which have produced numerous social consequences and questionable ethics.<sup>[1](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/29/547113818/uber-ends-its-controversial-post-ride-tracking-of-users-location),[2](https://www.revealnews.org/article/uber-said-it-protects-you-from-spying-security-sources-say-otherwise/),[3](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin),[4](https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads),[5](http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-says-some-people-are-watching-a-christmas-prince-every-day-2017-12),[6](https://www.propublica.org/article/governors-and-federal-agencies-are-blocking-accounts-on-facebook-and-twitter?utm_campaign=sprout&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=1512769907),[7](https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-the-trump-campaign-built-an-identity-database-and-used-facebook-ads-to-win-the-election-4ff7d24269ac),[8](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-40852227/the-digital-guru-who-helped-donald-trump-to-the-presidency),[9](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6)</sup> To better prepare you as citizens and professionals, we will respond to this datafication with a project that challenges you to learn how digital media and data are intertwined, since businesses produce data sets as integral texts about our everyday communication activities. Accordingly, this project involves collecting data about your everyday digital media practices.

This data set is necessary to complete all of the subsequent media projects in this course. The main point of this data collection is **NOT** statistical insight nor applying quasi-experimental design strategies, but to explore, examine, and gain insight into your writing practices and how digital media and data permeate it. In doing so, we will try to understand how digital media performs and communicates much more than what we may have originally thought.

To guide us through this process, we will all share the following broader research question: **How are our media practices linked with algorithmic audiences**? From there, each of you must choose and refine a particular topic as a path to explore one of your own prominent, digital media practices. Some past projects included the following topics:

To help us acclimate to the goals of this sub-project and the course, I will review this [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18c3SVpuc_m8mxHyvwAaf-wm1SPUTxYt-ZykAKx0zbJA/edit?usp=sharing) during class. I hope that it will provide you with more information and stir up more questions about the following 2 topics:

  1. What constitutes a good start to your Data Collection project.
  2. How your Data Collection project fits into the scheme of the other projects.
  3. How your Data Collection project provides you with the means to develop a good content strategy for your data-story: A single-page website.

## General process

Like any good project, this one begins with a simple, personal felt dissonance&mdash;a provocation that cannot be ignored. From there, you will do the following to complete your data collection:

<ol class="visual-list">
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/3844-datastory-topos.png" alt="Data-gathering image" />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Consider &amp; combine topos</h3>
      <p>
        Define the basic parameters of your study through an invention process that plays with topics of import.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/deardata-data-process-question.jpg" alt="How to distill a good set of questions." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Distill your data-story topic as research question(s)</h3>
      <p>Refine the topical parameters of your study with a sharp set of questions.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/deardata-data-process-collectionplan.png" alt="Plan for data collection." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Plan data-collection strategies</h3>
      <p>Learn how to create a balance of well-planned and creative set of techniques.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/posavec-data-gathering.png" alt="Collect the data." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Collect your data</h3>
      <p>Gather the data with your well-planned set of techniques, leaving room for creative hacks along the way!</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

Your data set will serve as the inventive seed by which your narrative grows as you work through the next 4 sub-projects: 1) A data visualization created in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics); 2) Wireframes to help you sketch out a plan for your data-story website; 3) Videos that draw out the contextual details and refined points of the narrative for your website; and 4) A single-page website that will tell the entire arch of your data story.

## Rubric

The following rubric has been modified from <a href="https://youtu.be/dwj22Fm3n5g?t=799" target="_blank">Posavec's explanation</a> about her own rules by which she assesses her data-work:

<ul>
  <li>
    Data integrity: If necessary, logs changes, modifications, and/or omissions with data collection</li>
  <li>
    Consistently log your data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet every evening</li>
  <li>
    Follows basic <i>tidy data</i> guidelines:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Rows</b>: Clear unit indexed per row: Every instance that I do X; no spaces between rows.</li>
        <li><b>Columns</b>: Meaningful column names; First column designated for unique identifier; Definitions applied with the notes feature; Format and arrangement of columns help outside readers and yourself understand and use the data.</li>
        <li><b>Cells</b>: 1 value, consistency of values, modify sheet according to redundancies, and limited amount of more complex cell data (1 preferable; 2 at the most)</li>
        <li><b>Sheets features</b>: Meaningful uses of some spreadsheet features: conditional formatting, frozen header, etc.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If deemed important for future consideration, contextualize datapoints with notes about the moment.</li>
</ul>
