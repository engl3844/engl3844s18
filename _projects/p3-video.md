## Description

As we learned from Gallagher, writers now write with and for algorithms. Now, in the second phase of the course, we will approach the other side of Gallagher's call: To understand and learn how people write algorithms to collect and use data about our digital practices. Accordingly, each of you will research and compose a video that explains a broader social matter about how corporations and companies commodify user practices with digital media.

To help you consider what to explain, consider some of the following topics, and be sure to see the <a href="/resources/" target="_blank">Resources</a> page for some initial sources:

  - <b>Algorithmic Audiences</b>: Pick up where we left off by digging deeper into how a people write and write with algorithms to serve-up and circulate content. What are the broader implications?
  - <b>Data Brokering</b>: How are you and your activities commodified and sold to 3rd parties?
  - <b>Psychographics</b>: How do companies use your data to categorize you into particular rhetorical audiences at an aggregate level?
  - <b>Public / Private</b>: How can you think more explicitly how you digital practice may blur the lines between public and private activity?
  - <b>User Rights</b>: Research government regulations and a company's End-User License Agreement (EULA). Such research serves as one important document that can help you better understand how particular applications define your rights, when agreeing to use their service.

<em>Overall, your goal is to put your research skills into action, as you learn and apply video composition skills to create a short **explanatory** video about the data-collection practices connected to users' social media practices</em>. In class, we will learn their generic conventions that will provide us the common ground by nalyze some videos within the genre of "[Complex-thing] Explained."

To create the videos, I will create <i>ad hoc</i> groups based on what video editing software you decide to use for this project:

  - Adobe Premiere
  - Lightworks or Windows MovieMaker (for PC)
  - Apple iMovie

 Based on your editing software, you will be sorted into groups that are conducive for sharing ideas, resources, and strategies.

## General process

1. Learn about some basic video composition conventions of the <i>Explained</i> genre.
2. Learn how to seek out, analyze, choose, and adapt similar generic conventions to help you tell your data-story meaningfully.
3. Learn about basic editing cuts and composition techniques.
4. Learn how to create a storyboard that outlines your video.
5. Learn about basic video codecs and file formats.
6. Export and submit your 3-5 minute video.
